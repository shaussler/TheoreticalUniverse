Deriving the Faraday-Maxwell Tensor from the 1865 Maxwell Equations
===================================================================

In this article, I present a simple and elegant derivation of the
Faraday-Maxwell tensor. This derivation is very much inspired by Minkowski's
1908 paper: `The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving
Bodies
<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:The_Fundamental_Equations_for_Electromagnetic_Processes_in_Moving_Bodies>`_.

I find it quite interesting that despite the obviousness of this derivation, I
could not find it anywhere. If I am mistaken and you know of a textbook,
youtube video, or some place in the internet, please let me know and I will add
a reference in this article. You can open an issue or directly correct and send
a merge request on my `github repository
<https://github.com/shaussler/electromagnetism/actions/runs/6444649784>`_.

Mr. Maxwell published in 1865 `A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field>`_
(`pdf <https://www.jstor.org/stable/108892>`_).
The original formulation uses differential expressions, as opposed to the
modern vector formulation proposed by Mr. Heaviside. We had no concept of
vectors in 1865!
