.. code:: bash

   # Install build dependencies
   pip install wheel setuptools

   # Install pycartan and dependencies
   pip install numpy sympy scipy
   pip install symbtools
   pip install pycartan

   # Build theoretical_python
   python setup.py bdist_wheel

   # Install theoretical_python
   pip install dist/theoretical_python*.whl

git
---

Clone repository:

.. code:: bash

   https://shaussler.github.io/TheoreticalUniverse/

``cd`` and create your branch:

.. code:: bash

   cd TheoreticalUniverse
   git checkout -b your_contribution

Do your changes and send a merge request. Upon acceptance, an automated
pipeline is started and your contribution rolled out.

Build locally
-------------

The site is serverd on ``localhost:8000``. From the
``TheoreticalUniverse/theoretical_universe`` directory, run:

.. code:: bash

   make clean
   sphinx-build ./ _build/html/
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory  _build/html/

To build in parallel:

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-build -j 4 ./ _build/html/

To automaticall update on modifications:

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-autobuild -j 4 ./ _build/html/

Hiding Content under Construction
---------------------------------

Since I am working from my mobile phone, the sphinx configuration checks if the
environment variable ``TERMUX_VERSION`` is set in order to determine whether
draft content should be shown. To hide content, use:

.. code:: rst

   .. ifconfig:: draft in ('yes')

Dropdown
--------

You can keep a dropdown amdonition while working by setting the ``:class:``
to ``toggle-shown``.

.. code::

   .. admonition:: All Calculation Steps
      :class: dropdown,toggle-shown

neovim configuration
--------------------

I use neovim on Android termux and you might find my configuration helpfull,
should you want to correct, modify or add to this serie of articles. To install
neovim plugins:

.. code:: bash

   curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

And use the configuration included in the repository:

.. literalinclude:: conf/init.vim
   :language: vim
