Running calculations
--------------------

.. {{{

.. warning::

   This is not used anymore, I found a way to simplify calculations with a
   permutation operator. Also the work to be put in writing symbolic
   computation is more than just perform the calculations.

Some of the calculations were performed using symbolic computation software. I
found only one library capable of performing symbolic calculations with
differential forms: `pycartan <https://github.com/TUD-RST/pycartan>`_. However,
this library has not been updated since 2017 and is limited to Euclidean
geometries.

To extend its functionality to Minkowski space, I monkey-patched the library.
You can install all required dependencies by running:

.. code:: bash

   # Install build dependencies
   # --------------------------

   pip install wheel setuptools

   # Install pycartan and dependencies
   # ---------------------------------

   pip install numpy sympy scipy
   pip install symbtools
   pip install pycartan

   # Build theoretical_python
   # ------------------------

   python setup.py bdist_wheel

   # Install theoretical_python
   # --------------------------

   pip install dist/theoretical_python*.whl

Build locally
-------------

.. {{{

The site is served on ``localhost:8000``. From the
``TheoreticalUniverse/theoretical_universe`` directory, run:

.. code:: bash

   make clean
   sphinx-build ./ _build/html/
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory  _build/html/

To build in parallel:

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-build -j 4 ./ _build/html/

To automaticall update on modifications:

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-autobuild -j 4 ./ _build/html/

.. }}}

Check for broken links
----------------------

.. {{{

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-build ./ _build/html/ -b linkcheck

.. }}}

Hiding content under construction
---------------------------------

.. {{{

Since I am working from my mobile phone, the sphinx configuration checks if the
environment variable ``TERMUX_VERSION`` is set in order to determine whether
draft content should be shown. To hide content, use:

.. code:: rst

   .. ifconfig:: draft in ('yes')

. }}}

Dropdown
--------

.. {{{

You can keep a dropdown admonition while working by setting the ``:class:`` to
``toggle-shown``.

.. code::

   .. admonition:: All Calculation Steps
      :class: dropdown,toggle-shown

.. }}}
