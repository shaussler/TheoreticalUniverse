In this article, I use the language of differential forms to systematically
express the derivative, the differential, the gradient, the divergence, the
curl and the laplacian in three dimensions. I simplify the concept of the Hodge
dual by limiting the discussion to three dimensions, making it more accessible.

I assume the reader possesses a strong grasp of vector calculus and a
functional understanding of differential forms. To learn about differential
forms, `see yet another great video serie by Michael Penn
<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7&si=4dDrAZ-oKa1rI7B8>`_.
Implicitely assumed with the above requisites is a basic understanding of
tensor calculus, and in particular the concept of vector and covector. Some
familiarity with the concepts of of either Grassman Algebra, Clifford Algebra
(AKA Geometric Algebra), or Lie Algebra is not necessary but certainly welcome
for a deeper understanding of the antisymmetries at hand.

The Hodge Dual
--------------

.. {{{

The Hodge dual is often presented in a needlessly complex manner, taking into
account from the get go a number of dimensions above three, and any metric
signatures. The concept is natural with the three dimensions we are accustomed
to live in. Extending the idea then to 4-dimensional Minkowski space may feel
quite easier.

First consider a coordinate basis in 3 dimensions corresponding to our
intuitive understanding of space :math:`\mathbf{e}_x`, :math:`\mathbf{e}_y` and
:math:`\mathbf{e}_z`. Observe that we did not merely define three unit vectors,
but also three *unit surfaces* that we name using the wedge symbol
:math:`\wedge`. The surface along the :math:`x` and :math:`y` axis is named
:math:`\mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y`, along the :math:`y` and :math:`z`
axis :math:`\mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z`, and along the :math:`z` and
:math:`x` axis, :math:`\mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x`:

The naming of the surfaces is carefully chosen counterclock wise. The reason is
that not only we can define a surface (a number) from two vectors but also
given a vector together with a surface, we can uniquely determine the second
vector needed to obtain that surface. The surface need be oriented and a sign
convention chosen (counterclockwise is positive). For example,
:math:`\mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x = - \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_z`.

Each basis surface can be associated with a unique basis vector:

.. math::

   \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \rightarrow \mathbf{e}_z \\
   \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z \rightarrow \mathbf{e}_x \\
   \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x \rightarrow \mathbf{e}_y

We note this relation with the star :math:`\star` symbol:

.. math::

   \star \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y = \mathbf{e}_z \\
   \star \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{e}_x \\
   \star \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x = \mathbf{e}_y

This association defines a dual vector to every oriented surfaces and is called
the Hodge dual, noted with the star :math:`\star` operator. The relation holds
in both direction:

.. math::

   \star \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \\
   \star \mathbf{e}_x = \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z \\
   \star \mathbf{e}_y = \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x

The Hodge dual in three dimensions is the cross product. The cross product
defines a vector perpendicular to the surface whose length is proportional to
the amount of rotation:

.. math::

   \mathbf{e}_x \times \mathbf{e}_y = \star \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y = \mathbf{e}_z \\
   \mathbf{e}_y \times \mathbf{e}_z = \star \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{e}_x \\
   \mathbf{e}_z \times \mathbf{e}_x = \star \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x = \mathbf{e}_y

This establishes the deep connection between the Hodge dual, rotations,
surfaces, and the cross product.

Going one step futher, we observe that we did not merely define unit surfaces,
but also unit volumes that we note :math:`\mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y
\wedge \mathbf{e}_z`. We can associate the unit volume with numbers:

.. math::

   \star \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z

As well as:

.. math::

   \star \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{1}

Where :math:`\mathbf{1}` is the unit number. In other words any number can be
expressed as a linear combination of :math:`1`.

For the vector basis the following objects are defined:

* Scalars.
* Vectors.
* Bivectors correspoding to surfaces and often called pseudo-vectors.
* Trivectors corresponding to volumes and often called pseudo-scalars.

Placing the objects in front of a mirror:

* Scalars look the same.
* Vectors look the same.
* Surfaces are flipped and the sign changes.
* Volumes are flipped and the sign changes.

This is the reason behind the naming *pseudo-vector*. When placed in front of a
mirror, the sign of a positive oriented surface goes to negative. These objects
are associated to vectors through the hodge dual. This dual vectors flips
direction with the image of the oriented surface.

This is also the reason behind the name *pseudo-scalar*. When placed in front
of a mirror, the sign of a positive oriented volume goes to negative. These
objects are associated to scalars through the hodge dual. This dual sclar flips
its sign with the image of the oriented volume.

Formalism
---------

.. {{{

I use matrix notation in a manner which is not fully conventional, but that I
hope highlights symmetries and that the reader will find obvious. Everything in
a matrix is expressed with its basis vectors and can be reordered at will. For
example, a vector is often expressed with an implicit basis as:

.. math::

   v = \{ x \\ y \\ z\}

I merely propose to write the basis explicitely in the matrix:

.. math::

   v = \{ x \mathbf{e}_x \\ y \mathbf{e}_y \\ z \mathbf{e}_x \}

Which means that a :math:`+` sign can be added anywhere and the expression
written in the standard form:

.. math::

   v = x \mathbf{e}_x + y \mathbf{e}_y + z \mathbf{e}_x 

This is powerfull when using a pseudo-vector or pseudo-scalar basis, since the
elements of the matrix can be re-ordered at will.

.. math::

   \{                                          & +a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y & -a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_z \\
      -a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_x &                                          & +a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z \\
      +a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x & -a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_y &                                          \}
   =
   \{ + 2 a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z \\
      + 2 a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x \\
      + 2 a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \}

The transpose can be taken if it permits to use the usual rules of matrix
multiplication: 

.. math::

   \{                                          & -a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_x & +a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x \\
      +a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y &                                          & -a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_y \\
      -a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_z & +a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z &                                          \}

All above matrix representations can writen as a sum:

.. math::

   2 a^{yz} \mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z +
   2 a^{zx} \mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x +
   2 a^{xy} \mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y

We could have written a covector in the same explicit manner. This notation is
very conveniant when performing calculations in Cartan's framework as it
permits to identify and organize terms for practical calculations by falling
back to regular matrix multiplication.

The vector field :math:`\mathbf{F}` is noted with the musical isomorphism
:math:`\sharp` as :math:`F^\sharp`, which either declare :math:`F` is a vector,
or transform a covector to a vector:

.. math::

   \mathbf{F}=F^\sharp=(F^\sharp)^\sharp=(F^\flat)^\sharp

The component of :math:`F^\sharp` are noted with upper indices consistently
with the rules of Ricci calculus and utilizing Einstein summation convention.

Divergence
----------

.. {{{

.. admonition:: Proposition

   .. math::

      \star d \star F^\flat = \mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{F}

We begin with :math:`F` as a vector :math:`\mathbf{F} = F^\sharp = F^i
\partial_i` and flatten:

.. math::

   F^\flat = \{ F^x \partial_x \\
                F^y \partial_y \\
                F^z \partial_z \}^\flat
           = \{ F^x dx \\
                F^y dy \\
                F^z dz \}

Apply the :math:`\star` operator:

.. math::

   \star F^\flat = \{ F^x \star dx     \\ F^y \star dy     \\ F^z \star dz     \}
                 = \{ F^x dy \wedge dz \\ F^y dz \wedge dx \\ F^z dx \wedge dy \}

Apply the :math:`d` operator:

.. math::

   d \star F^\flat = d \{ F^x dy \wedge dz \\
                          F^y dz \wedge dx \\
                          F^z dx \wedge dy \}
   = \{ \partial_x F^x dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
        \partial_y F^y dy \wedge dz \wedge dx \\
        \partial_z F^z dz \wedge dx \wedge dy \}
   = \{ \partial_x F^x dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
        \partial_y F^y dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
        \partial_z F^z dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \}

Which can be brought back to a zero form by applying yet again the Hodge star: 

.. math::

   \star d \star F^\flat
   = \{ \partial_x F^x \star dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
        \partial_y F^y \star dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
        \partial_z F^z \star dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \}
   = \{ \partial_x F^x \mathbf{1} \\
        \partial_y F^y \mathbf{1} \\
        \partial_z F^z \mathbf{1} \}
   = \partial_x F^x + \partial_y F^y + \partial_z F^z

Curl
----

.. {{{

.. admonition:: Proposition

   .. math::
   
      (\star(dF^\flat))^\sharp = \nabla^\sharp \times F^\sharp


The full expression of the curl of a vector field is

.. math::

   \nabla^\sharp \times F^\sharp =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial F^y) \; \partial_x \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial F^z) \; \partial_y \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial F^x) \; \partial_z \}

We demonstrate this is also equal to:

The vector field is:

.. math::

   F^\sharp = \{ F^x \px \\ F^y \py \\ F^z \pz \}
            = F^x \px + F^y \py + F^z \pz

Flattening the vector field result in:

.. math::

   F^\flat = \{ F^x dx \\ F^y dy \\ F^z dz \}
           = F^x dx + F^y dy + F^z dz

Taking the differential, we have: 

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{ \partial_x F^x dx \wedge dx & \partial_y F^x dy \wedge dx & \partial_z F^x dz \wedge dx \\
      \partial_x F^y dx \wedge dy & \partial_y F^y dy \wedge dy & \partial_z F^y dz \wedge dy \\
      \partial_x F^z dx \wedge dz & \partial_y F^z dy \wedge dy & \partial_z F^z dz \wedge dz \}

Or with more natural row/column convention:

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{ \partial_x F^x dx \wedge dx & \partial_x F^y dx \wedge dy & \partial_x F^z dx \wedge dz \\
      \partial_y F^x dy \wedge dx & \partial_y F^y dy \wedge dy & \partial_y F^z dy \wedge dy \\
      \partial_z F^x dz \wedge dx & \partial_z F^y dz \wedge dy & \partial_z F^z dz \wedge dz \}

Where :math:`dx^i \wedge dx^i = 0`:

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{                             & \partial_x F^y dx \wedge dy & \partial_x F^z dx \wedge dz \\
      \partial_y F^x dy \wedge dx &                             & \partial_y F^z dy \wedge dy \\
      \partial_z F^x dz \wedge dx & \partial_z F^y dz \wedge dy &                             \}


And :math:`dx^i \wedge dx^j = -dx^j \wedge dx^i`:

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{                              & +\partial_x F^y dx \wedge dy & -\partial_x F^z dz \wedge dx \\
      -\partial_y F^x dx \wedge dy &                              & +\partial_y F^z dy \wedge dy \\
      +\partial_z F^x dz \wedge dx & -\partial_z F^y dy \wedge dz &                              \}

That we reorder to:

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{ +\partial_y F^z dy \wedge dy - \partial_z F^y dy \wedge dz \\
      +\partial_z F^x dz \wedge dx - \partial_x F^z dz \wedge dx \\
      +\partial_x F^y dx \wedge dy - \partial_y F^x dx \wedge dy \}

.. math::

   dF^\flat =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial_z F^y) dy \wedge dz \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial_x F^z) dz \wedge dx \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial_y F^x) dx \wedge dy \}

Where we can now take the star operator:

.. math::

   \star dF^\flat =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial_z F^y) \star dy \wedge dz \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial_x F^z) \star dz \wedge dx \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial_y F^x) \star dx \wedge dy \}

.. math::

   \star dF^\flat =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial_z F^y) dx \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial_x F^z) dy \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial_y F^x) dz \}

We can then sharpen the covector to its vector form:

.. math::

   (\star dF^\flat)^\sharp
   =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial_z F^y) dx^\sharp \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial_x F^z) dy^\sharp \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial_y F^x) dz^\sharp \}

.. math::

   (\star dF^\flat)^\sharp
   =
   \{ (\partial_y F^z - \partial_z F^y) \px \\
      (\partial_z F^x - \partial_x F^z) \py \\
      (\partial_x F^y - \partial_y F^x) \pt \}

Taking the Hodge dual:

                 ) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\

Taking the Hodge dual, we tranform volumes to functions and obtain the
expression for the laplacian:

       \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x} +
       \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y} +

   The Laplacian is only valid for functions (a 1-form). The Laplacian can be
