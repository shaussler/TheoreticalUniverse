Rotations in Cartan's Formalism
===============================

.. rst-class:: custom-author

   by St√©phane Haussler

In this article, I express rotations in Cartan's formalism and improve on the
notation with the free matrix representation. Anti-symmetries pop out of the
Hodge star operator and when ordering the differential forms into matrices.
:math:`\mathfrak{so}(3)` and :math:`\mathfrak{so}(1,3)` matrices will make an
appearance *en passant*. Finally we simply stumble upon the electromagnetic
field tensor out of the blue.

The content of this article might not be wildely known as I have not found my
observations mentioned anywhere. Feel free to open an issue and I will include
a reference if you are aware of one. If you find mistakes, don't hesitate to
open an issue or directly provide corrections by sending a merge request to my
`Github repository <https://github.com/shaussler/TheoreticalUniverse/>`_.

I assume the reader posses a strong grasp of vector calculus as well as working
understanding of differential forms, the wedge product, and :ref:`the concept
of the Hodge dual <hodge_dual:The Hodge Dual>`. With respect to wording, I
interchangeably use the words *oriented surface*, *bivector* and
*pseudo-vectors* as they are :ref:`the same objects <hodge_dual:Pseudo vectors
and pseudo scalars>`, albeit named in different contexts.
