Revisiting the 1865 Maxwell's equations
=======================================

.. rst-class:: custom-author

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this article, I revisit the formulation of the equations for
electromagnetism as expressed by Professor James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. The
structure of the equations here is strongly inspired Minkowski's 1908 paper,
`The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies
<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:
The_Fundamental_Equations_for_Electromagnetic_Processes_in_Moving_Bodies>`_.
Starting from the widely recognized vector formulation introduced by Mr.
Heaviside, I rephrase this equations to adheres to the spirit of the 1865
formulation, albeit with modern notation and structuring.

I aim to argue that the 1865 formulation remains not only relevant today but
also highly useful. By reordering the terms and adopting modern notation, such
as that for partial derivatives, we can reveal its underlying structure and
gain valuable insights. These insights are not immediately obvious in the
standard modern vector formulation.

This page can be read on its own with no reference to other content on this
site. I assume the reader possesses a strong grasp of vector calculus,
including the vector dot and cross products.
