Revisiting the 1865 Maxwell's equations
=======================================

.. rst-class:: custom-author

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this page, I revisit the equations for electromagnetism expressed by
Professor James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 using a structure strongly inspired by
Hermann Minkowski's 1908 paper, `The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic
Processes in Moving Bodies <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:
The_Fundamental_Equations_for_Electromagnetic_Processes_in_Moving_Bodies>`_.
Starting from the widely recognized vector formulation introduced by Mr. Oliver
Heaviside, I rephrase this equations to adheres to the spirit of the 1865
formulation, albeit with modern notation and structuring.

My aim is to argue that the 1865 formulation not only remains relevant today
but also highly useful. With simple reordering and adoption of modern notation,
we reveal its underlying structure and gain valuable insights. These insights
are not immediately obvious using the commonly used vector formulation.

This page can be read on its own with no reference to other content on this
site. I assume the reader possesses a strong grasp of vector calculus,
including the vector dot and cross products.

Beyond the standard formulation
-------------------------------

The resulting equations and their symmetries are not only satisfying in
themselves, but also useful. They permit to reframe electromagnetism in terms
of the Faraday tensor, or alternatively in terms of differential forms. To dive
deeper down that rabbit hole, I direct you to my articles:
