Revisiting the 1865 Maxwell's equations
=======================================

.. rst-class:: custom-author

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this article, I revisit the formulation of the equations for
electromagnetism as expressed by Professor James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. The
form of the equations in this page draw strong inspiration from Minkowski's
1908 paper, `The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving
Bodies <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:
The_Fundamental_Equations_for_Electromagnetic_Processes_in_Moving_Bodies>`_.

I start from the widespread and most recognized vector formulation introduced
by Mr. Heaviside, and rephrase to a form that adheres in spirtit to the
original 1865 formulation, albeit with modern notation and splitting.

This page can be read on its own with no reference to other content on this
site. I assume the reader possesses a strong grasp of vector calculus,
including the vector dot and cross products.
