Theoretical Universe
====================

This is a personal compilation of papers focusing on mathematical physics. I am
conducting a thorough review of the Maxwell equations and their mathematical
expressions. Subsequently, my objective is to examine the field equations using
the mathematical framework that I find most effective. At present, I am solely
interested in the classical field equations and their mathematical
representation, with no intention to delve into field quantization.
