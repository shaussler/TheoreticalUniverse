      Maxwell Field Equations via Differential Forms

   .. rst-class:: custom-author

      by Stéphane Haussler

Within these pages, you will find the formulation of electromagnetism in terms
of Élie Cartan's differential forms, along with a systematic analysis of this
formulation.

In 1865, James Clerck Maxwell presented his groundbreaking work, `A Dynamical
Theory of the Electromagnetic Field
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field>`_
(`pdf <https://www.jstor.org/stable/108892>`_). This seminal paper united
electrostatics and magnetism, leading to significant discoveries. Mr. Maxwell
noted that his equations implied the propagation of waves at a constant speed,
which exactly matched the measured speed of light, thereby identifying light as
electromagnetic waves. Others observed that these equations implied an
astonishing fact: the speed of light is constant, regardless of the relative
motion of objects. This was experimentally confirmed by Albert Michelson and
Edward Morley, paving the way for the theory of special relativity. Later,
Albert Einstein drew inspiration from Mr. Maxwell's work once more when
developing the theory of general relativity, seeking a formulation that
resembled the field equations for electromagnetism.

The mathematical work of Mr. Maxwell is deeply rooted in experiments,
translating ideas, most notably from Mr. Michael Faraday, into mathematical
expressions. The original equations were presented using differential
expressions, which differ significantly from the standard modern vector
formulation. `Mr. Oliver Heaviside proposed both the concept of vectors, as
well as the modern standard vector form of the Maxwell's equations
<https://youtu.be/M12CJIuX8D4?si=nuOUEFmRu5Jx4jHJ>`_.

Further mathematical formulations include the tensor approach, `quaternions
<https://peeterjoot.com/2018/03/05/a-derivation-of-the-quaternion-maxwells-equations-using-geometric-algebra/>`_,
geometric algebra, and differential forms. There are more formulations I did
not look at (yet), but have for now settled on the differential form
formulation, as it feels to me the most elegant and complete approach. I could
however not find (free) material to my exact liking. Therefore, I am doing it
myself.

Some of the content of these articles, although certainly not *new*, may offer
insights not widely known. I present the details of all calculations to give
the reader a chance to follow and find mistakes. If you are aware of freely
available resources I should cite, open an issue and I will include a
reference. If you find errors, don't hesitate to directly provide corrections
by sending a merge request to `the Theoretical Universe Github repository
<https://github.com/shaussler/TheoreticalUniverse/>`_.

I point out the article :ref:`faraday tensor derivation` for its simplicity.
This derivation is straightforward and self-contained, requiring only knowledge
of vector calculus and matrix multiplication.

Subsequent articles assumes you, the reader, have a working understanding of
`tensor calculus <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus>`_, the
concept of vector/covector duality, `differential forms
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form>`_, `musicality
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_isomorphism>`_, `the exterior product
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra>`_, as well as `hodge duality
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator>`_. I gather all these
*tools* into what I call the :ref:`the Cartan-Hodge formalism <The Cartan-Hodge
Formalism>`. There you will find a personal overview of these concepts, which
can be used as review material, though certainly not as primary learning
material. I also introduce :ref:`the free matrix representation <The Free
Matrix Representation>`, which I hope the prospective reader will find obvious
and usefull for performing actual computations. For those looking to learn
about differential forms, `I loved the excellent video serie by Michael Penn
<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7&si=4dDrAZ-oKa1rI7B8>`_.

The pivotal aspects the present study lie in three articles:

* :ref:`Rotations in Minkowski Space`.
* :ref:`The Exterior Derivative of Rotations in Spacetime`
* :ref:`Maxwell's Equations via Differential Forms`

In the first article, differential forms are presented as a simple yet
powerfull concept for representing rotations, and generalize to
four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The connection to *standard* rotation
matrices is laid plain, along with the relation to the Lie algebra of the
Lorentz group :math:`\mathfrak{so}(1,3)`. The second article explores how to
perform a twist in spacetime, essentially applying a derivation operator to a
rotation. There, the exterior derivative of rotations in spacetime is
systematically analyzed. The final article links the exterior derivative of
rotations to Maxwell's equations by identification, revealing that we are
dealing with a twist, or to be more precise torque, in Minkowski spacetime.
This provides a comprehensive and coherent demonstration of how Maxwell's
equations emerge from the framework of differential forms and electromagnetism
is reduced to a single equation.

This serie was originally envisioned as a collection of short, standalone
articles. However, it has expanded beyond my initial expectation and evolved
into something more comprehensive.

.. topic:: Maxwell Equations in the Cartan-Hodge Formalism

   .. math::

      (d ⋆ - ⋆ d ) \begin{bmatrix}
        \E^x \; dx ∧ dt \\
        \E^y \; dy ∧ dt \\
        \E^z \; dz ∧ dt \\
         B^x \; dy ∧ dz \\
         B^y \; dz ∧ dx \\
         B^z \; dx ∧ dy \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix}
        + μ_0 c ρ \; dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\\
        - μ_0 J^x \; dt ∧ dy ∧ dz\\
        - μ_0 J^y \; dt ∧ dz ∧ dx\\
        - μ_0 J^z \; dt ∧ dx ∧ dy\\
      \end{bmatrix}

   Where :math:`d` is the exterior derivative, :math:`⋆` the Hodge star, and
   :math:`∧` the exterior product. :math:`\E^x`, :math:`\E^y` and :math:`\E^z`
   are the components of the electric field divided by the speed of light
   :math:`c`, and :math:`B^x`, :math:`B^y`, :math:`B^z` the components of the
   magnetic field. The term on the right hand side is the four-current, with
   :math:`μ_0` the permeability of free space, :math:`ρ` the volume charge
   density, and :math:`J^x`, :math:`J^y`, :math:`J^z` the components of the
   conventional current density.

.. rubric:: :ref:`The Cartan-Hodge Formalism`

This section reviews the mathematical objects used in this work. Basis vectors
are identified as partial derivatives :math:`\mathbf{e_μ} = ∂_μ`, which in
turns permits to express basis covectors as differentials :math:`\mathbf{e^μ} =
dx^μ`. The musical sharp operator :math:`♯` transforms covectors to vectors,
and the musical flat operator :math:`♭` transforms vectors to covectors. The
concept of the Hodge dual and the star operator :math:`⋆` are explained.
Finally, I introduce the free matrix representation, which I hope readers will
find obvious enough.

I encapsulate these concepts in what I name the Cartan-Hodge formalism. This
comprehensive framework facilitates the systematic analysis of rotation
representation in differential form and a thorough examination of differential
operators within this context.

.. rubric:: :ref:`Rotations in Differential Form`

This section contains a systematic analyis of the representation of rotations
in Euclidean three-dimensional space, as well as its generalization to
four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Rotations are expressed as linear
combinations of basis rotations in each planes. The expressions as double
covariant tensors, double contravariant tensors, and mixed tensors are derived.
Symmetries are systematically analyzed. In this section, we get the first
insight about the deep connection between the electromagnetism and rotations in
spacetime.
