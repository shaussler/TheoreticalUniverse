Where this is going
===================

This series was initially conceived as a set of short, independent articles.
However, it has expanded beyond my initial expectation. It all begins with the
derivation of the electromagnetic field tensor from Maxwell's equations of
1865, a process straightforward for those with a grasp of vector calculus and
matrix multiplication.

My exploration extended to Riemannian manifolds, differential forms, and the
exterior derivative. I delved into musical isomorphisms and the Hodge dual,
encapsulating these concepts in what I term *the Cartan-Hodge formalism*. This
comprehensive framework facilitated a systematic analysis of rotation
representation in differential form and a thorough examination of differential
operators within this context. Notably, I dissected the exterior derivative of
rotations, leading to the my understanding that it precisely mirrors Maxwell's
equations, offering a fully coherent demonstration of the formulation of
Maxwell's equations in differential form.

Consequently, the starting article comprises a rewriting of Maxwell's
equations, echoing the spirit of their original 1865 formulation.
