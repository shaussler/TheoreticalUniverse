.. rubric:: Differential Forms by Michael Penn

The serie `Differential Forms
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7>`_ by
`Michael Penn <https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath>`_ are comprehensive
lectures covering the exterior product, the exterior derivative, and the Hodge
operator. The Hodge dual in 4-dimensional Minkowski space is included and
Maxwell's equations via differential forms introduced.

.. rubric:: Maxwell's Theory in Relativistic Notations by Neil Turok

In `14/15 PSI - Relativity - Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/14090007>`_, `Neil
Turok <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Turok>`_ gives a concise and precise
presentation of Maxwell's equations in tensor notation.

.. rubric:: Review of Manifold Basics by Ruth Gregory

In her `Gravitational Physics Lecture of January 8, 2024
<https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ gives a rushed overview of
Manifold basics. This is not learning material though, but review material.

There is great content from the Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive
that I am going through. Here is a list of videos, which I have not watched
yet.

* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 2 <https://pirsa.org/24010049>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 3 <https://pirsa.org/24010050>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 4 <https://pirsa.org/24010051>`_

* `PSI 2018/2019 - Gravitational Physics - Lecture 3 - Cartan's formalism:
  connection & curvature <https://pirsa.org/19010053>`_

* `PSI 2017/2018 - Gravitational Physics - Lecture 3: Applying Cartan:
  Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes -- Schwarzschild, Relativistic Stars.
  <https://pirsa.org/18010023>`_

.. rubric:: Relativity and Cosmology II

I am yet to watch the serie `Relativity and Cosmology II
<https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/courses/rcii21.html>`_ by Claus
Kiefer.

I am interested in Cartan connections and Cartan structure equations and the
following content:

* `10.1 - 3. Vectors, covectors and tensors.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvPFnLgtI7g&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=9>`_
* `10.4 - 5. The exterior algebra and exterior ùëù-forms.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK6p9N4jyik&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=11>`_
* `10.6. Connections and Cartan equations.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJFjFyXiZD4&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=11>`_
* `10.7 - 8. Metricity, applications, integration, Maxwell and Einstein equations.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpm6FXKC7Q&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=12>`_

Q&A

.. rubric:: Quora

* `Using Maxwell's equations (in differential form), how does one explain that
  an electromagnetic wave can propagate in a vacuum?
