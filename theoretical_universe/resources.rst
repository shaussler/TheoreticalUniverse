Resources
=========

In this section, I list and review the best material I came across about the
mathematics I am interested in.

Lectures
--------

.. rubric:: Differential Forms by Michael Penn

The serie `Differential Forms
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7>`_ by
`Michael Penn <https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath>`_ are comprehensive
lectures covering the exterior product, the exterior derivative, and the Hodge
operator. The Hodge dual in 4-dimensional Minkowski space is included and
Maxwell's equations via differential forms introduced.

.. rubric:: Maxwell's Theory in Relativistic Notations by Neil Turok

In `14/15 PSI - Relativity - Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/14090007>`_, `Neil
Turok <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Turok>`_ gives a concise and
precise presentation of Maxwell's equations in tensor notation.

.. rubric:: Review of Manifold Basics by Ruth Gregory

In her `Gravitational Physics Lecture of January 8, 2024
<https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ gives a rushed overview of
Manifold basics. This is not learning material though, but review material.

.. rubric:: Cartan's method of moving frames, tetrads, and Cartan’s Structure
   Equations

This covers the tetrad formalism, non-coordinate bases, Cartan's method of
moving frames, and Cartan's structure equations. The more interesting the
topic, the fewer resources you’ll find online. This is my playlist. I recommend
starting *slowly* with `James Cook <https://www.youtube.com/@jamescook5617>`_:

* `General Relativity: Lecture 20: tetrad method, Lorentzian frames, 5-16-23
  <https://youtu.be/Ul9hCQqXaEg?si=16QWiiolXUqVN0sU>`_
* `General Relativity: Lecture 20 part2: calculating via tetrad formalism,
  future reading <https://youtu.be/cQUDEQd2jec?si=w6QMo138Gnx0KwBa>`_

In her lecture on Cartan's formalism, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ relates the covariant
derivative to the abstract definition of a *derivation*. She presents Cartan's
method of moving frames and derives Cartan's first structure equation. This is
not for the faint-hearted. Be familiar with the concept of a `non-coordinate
basis <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_basis>`_. Fasten your seatbelt
and be prepare to watch thrice:

* `PSI 2018/2019 - Gravitational Physics - Lecture 3 - Cartan's formalism:
  connection & curvature <https://pirsa.org/19010053>`_

.. rubric:: Gravitational Physics Lecture by Ruth Gregory

There is great content from the Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive
that I am going through. Here is a list of videos I intend to watch later.

* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 2 <https://pirsa.org/24010049>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 3 <https://pirsa.org/24010050>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 4 <https://pirsa.org/24010051>`_

* `PSI 2017/2018 - Gravitational Physics - Lecture 3: Applying Cartan:
  Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes -- Schwarzschild, Relativistic Stars.
  <https://pirsa.org/18010023>`_

.. rubric:: Relativity and Cosmology II

I am yet to watch the serie `Relativity and Cosmology II
<https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/courses/rcii21.html>`_ by Claus
Kiefer.

I am interested in Cartan connections and Cartan structure equations and the
following content:

* `10.1 - 3. Vectors, covectors and tensors.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvPFnLgtI7g&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=9>`_
* `10.4 - 5. The exterior algebra and exterior 𝑝-forms.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK6p9N4jyik&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=11>`_
* `10.6. Connections and Cartan equations.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJFjFyXiZD4&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=11>`_
* `10.7 - 8. Metricity, applications, integration, Maxwell and Einstein equations.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpm6FXKC7Q&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=12>`_

Q&A

I sometimes participate in discussions, which are gathered here:
