On this page, I list and review materials I have come across, enjoyed, and
learned from in the areas of mathematics and physics that interest me.

Lectures
--------

.. rubric:: Differential forms by Michael Penn

The serie `Differential Forms
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7>`_ by
`Michael Penn <https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath>`_ are comprehensive
lectures covering the exterior product, the exterior derivative, and the Hodge
operator. The Hodge dual in 4-dimensional Minkowski space is included and
Maxwell's equations via differential forms introduced.

.. rubric:: Maxwell's theory in relativistic notations by Neil Turok

In `14/15 PSI - Relativity - Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/14090007>`_, `Neil
Turok <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Turok>`_ gives a concise and
precise presentation of Maxwell's equations in tensor notation.

.. rubric:: Representations of Maxwell's equations by Peter Joot

In his video series, `Representations of Maxwell's equations
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YGrLVjbUQ&list=PL7_teJROyYjilE9R_7PpFpkqqDvSaxj4c>`_,
`Peter Joot <https://www.youtube.com/@PeeterJoot>`_, explores a wide range of
formulations of Maxwell's equations in great detail:

* Vector formulation
* Tensor formulation
* Geometric algebra formulation
* Spacetime algebra formulation
* Differential forms formulation

I appreciated the thorough step-by-step derivations. For completeness, since
the forumlation in terms of quaternions is not covered in these videos, Peter
Joot has nontheless `a blog post about this
<https://peeterjoot.com/2018/03/05/a-derivation-of-the-quaternion-maxwells-equations-using-geometric-algebra/>`_.
I have watched the whole video series but have not gone through the details of
the blog post.

.. rubric:: Review of manifold basics by Ruth Gregory

In her `Gravitational Physics Lecture of January 8, 2024
<https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ gives a rushed overview of
Manifold basics. This is not learning material though, but review material.

.. rubric:: Cartan's method of moving frames, tetrads, and Cartan‚Äôs structure
   equations

This covers the tetrad formalism, non-coordinate bases, Cartan's method of
moving frames, and Cartan's structure equations. The more interesting the
topic, the fewer resources you‚Äôll find online. This is my playlist. I recommend
starting *slowly* with `James Cook <https://www.youtube.com/@jamescook5617>`_:

* `General Relativity: Lecture 20: tetrad method, Lorentzian frames, 5-16-23
  <https://youtu.be/Ul9hCQqXaEg?si=16QWiiolXUqVN0sU>`_
* `General Relativity: Lecture 20 part2: calculating via tetrad formalism,
  future reading <https://youtu.be/cQUDEQd2jec?si=w6QMo138Gnx0KwBa>`_

In her lecture on Cartan's formalism, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ relates the covariant
derivative to the abstract definition of a *derivation*. She presents Cartan's
method of moving frames and derives Cartan's first structure equation. This is
not for the faint-hearted. Be familiar with the concept of a `non-coordinate
basis <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_basis>`_. Fasten your seatbelt
and be prepare to watch thrice:

* `PSI 2018/2019 - Gravitational Physics - Lecture 3 - Cartan's formalism:
  connection & curvature <https://pirsa.org/19010053>`_

.. rubric:: Connection forms

I have not gone through the material below:

.. rubric:: Gravitational physics lecture by Ruth Gregory

There is great content from the Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive
that I am going through. Here is a list of videos I intend to watch later.

* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_
* `Gravitational Physics Lecture 2 <https://pirsa.org/24010049>`_

  Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes -- Schwarzschild, Relativistic Stars.
  <https://pirsa.org/18010023>`_

.. rubric:: Relativity and cosmology II

I am yet to watch the serie `Relativity and Cosmology II
<https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gravitation/courses/rcii21.html>`_ by Claus
Kiefer.

.. rubric:: Cartan

I am interested in Cartan connections and Cartan structure equations and the
following content:

* `10.1 - 3. Vectors, covectors and tensors.
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvPFnLgtI7g&list=PLelGJJV9hME1I04Cd8pbXd5GuN-qw1les&index=9>`_
* `10.4 - 5. The exterior algebra and exterior ùëù-forms.

Q&A

I sometimes but rarely participate in discussions, which are gathered here:

.. rubric:: Physics Stackexchange

* `Deriving the Electromagnetic Tensor
  <https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/91421/deriving-the-electromagnetic-tensor/811409#811409>`_
