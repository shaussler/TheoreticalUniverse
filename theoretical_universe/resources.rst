.. rubric:: Differential Forms by Michael Penn

The serie `Differential Forms
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqzQZtDZO_9s2HEMRJnaOTX7>`_ by
`Michael Penn <https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath>`_ are comprehensive
lectures covering the exterior product, the exterior derivative, and the Hodge
operator. The Hodge dual in 4-dimensional Minkowski space is included and
Maxwell's equations via differential forms introduced.

.. rubric:: Maxwell's Theory in Relativistic Notations by Neil Turok

In `14/15 PSI - Relativity - Lecture 1 <https://pirsa.org/14090007>`_, `Neil
Turok <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Turok>`_ gives a concise and precise
presentation of Maxwell's equations in tensor notation.

.. rubric:: Review of Manifold Basics by Ruth Gregory

In her `Gravitational Physics Lecture of January 8, 2024
<https://pirsa.org/24010048>`_, `Ruth Gregory
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gregory>`_ gives a rushed overview of
Manifold basics. This is not learning material though, but review material.
