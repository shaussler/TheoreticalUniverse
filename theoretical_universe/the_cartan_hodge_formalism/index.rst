The Cartan-Hodge Formalism
==========================

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this serie of articles, I introduce the Cartan-Hodge formalism, which
amalgamates various notions and notations into a unified framework for
performing calculations and highlighting symmetries. Practical computations
follow clear and concise rules, with each step presented in a compact and
comprehensible manner.

This formalism closely intertwines with tensor calculus and differential forms.
The notation extends the abstract index notation (Ricci calculus) by explicitly
specifying the tensor basis. The musical flat (:math:`♭`) and sharp (:math:`♯`)
operators convert vectors to covectors and vice versa. Hodge duality assumes a
central role, transitioning tensors between spaces and their dual complements.
Additionally, I introduce the free matrix notation to streamline calculations,
often allowing a straightforward return to matrix multiplication.

I assume the reader possesses a solid understanding of vector and tensor
calculus, as well as a working familiarity with differential forms
