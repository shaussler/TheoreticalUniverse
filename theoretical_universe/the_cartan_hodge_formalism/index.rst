In this serie of articles, I introduce the Cartan-Hodge formalism, which
bundles the notions of *tensor calculus*, *musical operators*, *Hodge duality*,
*exterior derivative*, and the *free matrix representation* into a unified
framework for performing calculations and highlighting symmetries. Practical
computations follow clear and concise rules, with each step presented in a
compact and comprehensible manner. This section is not necessarily a
comprehensive introduction into these subjects, but recalls basic definitions
and properties necessary to perform calculations. I assume the reader possesses
a solid understanding of vector and tensor calculus, as well as a working
familiarity with differential forms and the exterior derivative.

Basis vectors
-------------

.. {{{

The Euclidean basis vectors are traditionally noted :math:`\mathbf{e}_x`,
:math:`\mathbf{e}_y`, and :math:`\mathbf{e}_z`. It can be demonstrated that the
basis vectors are the partial derivatives:

.. math:: \mathbf{e}_i = ∂_i

Any vector can  be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors as:

.. math:: a \; ∂_x + b \; ∂_y + c \; ∂_z

The differential applied to the basis vectors results in the Kronecker
:math:`δ`:

.. math:: dx^i (∂_j) = δ^i_j

Therefore the dual basis covectors are:

.. math::

   \mathbf{e}^i = dx^i

And a covariant dual covector is expressed as linear combination of the basis
covectors:

.. math:: a \; dx + b \; dy + c \; dz

.. }}}

Musicality
----------

.. {{{

With the musical flat :math:`♭` and sharp :math:`♯` symbols, covectors and
vectors are explicetely declared. For example, a contravariant three-vector is
declared with the sharp operator :math:`♯` as:

.. math:: V^♯ = a \; ∂_x + b \; ∂_y + c \; ∂_z

The musical flat :math:`♭` and sharp :math:`♯` symbols are further utilzed as
operators converting vectors to covectors and vice versa. For example, a
three-vector with euclidean metric :math:`δ` is flattend to a three-covector
with:

.. math::

   V^{♭} &= (V^♯)^♭                                                         \\
         &= a \; ∂_x^♭ + b \; ∂_y^♭ + c \; ∂_z^♭                            \\
         &= a \; δ_{xi} \; dx^i + b \; δ_{yi} \; dx^i + c \; δ_{zi} \; dx^i \\
         &= a \; dx + b \; dy + c \; dz                                     \\

.. }}}

The free matrix representation
------------------------------

.. {{{

With the *free matrix representation*, vectors can be ordered into arbitray
matrix, while keeping the tensor basis is explicitly included. A vector can the
be expressed explicitly as:

.. math::

   V^♯ = \begin{bmatrix}
     a \; ∂_x \\
     b \; ∂_y \\
     c \; ∂_z \\
   \end{bmatrix}

The representation can be freely modified to best facilitate calculations, with
the brackets acting as an operator :math:`\begin{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}` adding
elements together. As an example, the following row representation of a vector is
also valid in the free matrix representation:

.. math::

   V^♯ = \begin{bmatrix} a \; ∂_x & b \; ∂_y & c \; ∂_z \end{bmatrix}
