The Cartan-Hodge Formalism
==========================

.. rst-class:: custom-author

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this series of articles, I will present what I will refer to as the
Cartan-Hodge formalism. This formalism puts together notions and notations into
a common framework that can be used to perform calculations and highlight
symmetries. That is calculations can be brought perfomed by following clear
rules, and permit to write these rules in a compact and intellegible manner.

The formalism is closely related to and extend tensor Calculus, as well as
differential forms. In particular the notation specifies the Abstract Index
Notation (otherwise known as Ricci caculus). With the musical flat :math:`♭`
and sharp :math:`♯` operators, vectors can be transformed to covectors. The
Hodge duality plays a central role to swith from one space to the complementary
space. Finally, I introduce the free matrix notation to simplify calculations,
and often permit to fall back to matrix multiplication in a straightforward
manner.

I assume the reader posses strong knowledge of vector and tensor calculus, as
well as working knowledge of differential forms.
