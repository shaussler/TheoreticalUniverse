The Cartan-Hodge Formalism
==========================

   by Stéphane Haussler

In this series of articles, I present what I refer to as the Cartan-Hodge
formalism. The formalism brings together notions and notations into a common
framework that can be used to perform calculations and highlight symmetries.
Practical calculations can be perfomed following clear rules, with each step
written in a compact and intellegible manner.

The formalism is closely related to tensor Calculus as well as differential
forms. The notation specifies the Abstract Index Notation (Ricci caculus). The
musical flat :math:`♭` and sharp :math:`♯` operators transform vectors to
covectors and vice versa. Hodge duality plays a central role, bringing tensors
from one space to the dual complement. Finally, I introduce the free matrix
notation to simplify calculations, and often permit to fall back to matrix
multiplication in a straightforward manner.

I assume the reader posses strong knowledge of vector and tensor calculus, as
well as working knowledge of differential forms.
