   Under construction

The vector field :math:`\mathbf{F}` is noted with the musical isomorphism
:math:`\sharp` as :math:`F^\sharp`, which either declare :math:`F` is a vector,
or transform a covector to a vector. The flat operator :math:`\flat` brings a
vector to a covector.

.. math::

   \mathbf{F}=F^\sharp=(F^\sharp)^\sharp=(F^\flat)^\sharp = v^i \mathbf{e}_i
